##Comments
- level 3
- comments are mostly present, not sure if every comment is strictly needed. HTML comments are missing.

##Names
- level 4
- names are in the correct format and cleary describe what the function does or variable is

##Formatting
- level 3
- identation and semicolons mostly correct, code is well separated in blocks

##Orginization 
- level 3
- code seems ordered in a logical manner, good use of multiple javascript files for each visualisation

##Flow
- level 3
- there is some nesting, some functions do more than one thing

##Idiom
- level 3
- smart use of libraries for bulletchart and worldmap


##Structure
- level 4
- code is well structured in multiple files, very understandable
